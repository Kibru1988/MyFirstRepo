The CBE has a rich history as a cornerstone of Ethiopia's financial sector. It was established in 1942, initially as the State Bank of Ethiopia, and played a crucial role in the post-WWII economic reconstruction and development of the country. Over the decades, it has been central to various national economic policies and has grown to become the largest bank in Ethiopia, with a significant impact on the nation's financial landscape. Working there connects you directly to this legacy of economic development and financial stability in Ethiopia."
